- 👋 Hey, I’m @WolfOfAllStreet,

- 👀 I’m interested in smart contracts that attract SNIPER BOT GENERATED liquidity without damaging a token launch..

- 🌱 I’m currently learning that moral minds in the crypto space are the true gems..

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on engineering MARKET MAKER FRIENDLY token contracts that facilitate liquidity management for SETTING PRICE FLOORS, and that dynamically throttle bots and whales WITHOUT STEALING THEIR FUCKING MONEY by blacklisting them.  

- 📫 How to reach me ... @awoulfe on TG ... 1wolfofallstreets@protonmail.com
